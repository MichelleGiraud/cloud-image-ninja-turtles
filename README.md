# Hack days project: File upload to GCP

Group name: Cloud Image Ninja Turtles

Group participants: Michelle, Pernilla, Sally, Zack.

Project description: We want to create a solution for uploading files/images to a GCP storage bucket. The images need to be scanned for malware using ClamAV, which runs in a Docker container in Cloud Run. We want to use Terraform to manage our GCP services.
